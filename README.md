# Cricket Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end cricket data analytics pipeline that involves data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Power BI. The project is created from the guide and tutorial made by the Codebasics and aims to extract insights from cricket match statistics.

## Features
- Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for key insights
- Visualization of player and team statistics using Power BI

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data scraping and processing.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data processing workflow.
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## Files and Directories
- `Data Analystic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data processing steps.
- `t20_data_analystic.pdf`: Power BI dashboard visualizing key cricket data insights.
- `.json`: Zip file containing raw and unprocessed datasets.
- `.csv`: Files are the final files from exported after preprocessing and the one used for the dashboard.
- `t20_data_analystic.pbis`: PowerBI file which that contains the interactive dashboard.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to process and analyze cricket data.
- Open `t20_data_analystic.pdf` to explore Power BI visualizations.
- Modify Python scripts to scrape or analyze different datasets.

## Future Improvements
- Automate web scraping for real-time data updates.
- Expand analysis to include more T20 leagues.
- Enhance Power BI dashboard with additional filters and metrics.
- Add new Dashboard for Mobile layout.
